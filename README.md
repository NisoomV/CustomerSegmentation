## Project Overview

Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on common characteristics to optimize business strategies. This project uses clustering techniques to identify patterns in customer behavior, such as spending habits, purchase frequency, and recency.


### Key Features:

-   **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare customer data for analysis by engineering `Recency` field and standardize the RFM metrics.
-   **Clustering Models**: Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to group customers.
-   **Visualization**: Use Tableau to create an interactive dashboard to explore the clusters.

### Tools:

-   **Jupyter Notebook**: To run clustering analysis.
-   **Tableau**: For dashboard visualization.
